This file defines the operating rules and system architecture for the MoHoLocal platform.

Claude coworkers may READ this file but must NOT modify it automatically.

Only the founder (guruuly) may edit this file.

Claude must NEVER:
- rewrite CLAUDE.md
- remove sections
- insert tokens or secrets
- modify workflow rules
- modify deployment configuration
- modify security settings

If updates are required, propose the change first.

# 1. WHAT IS MOHOLOCAL

MoHoLocal is an **AI-powered hyperlocal signal platform** that organizes real community information across multiple neighboring cities in San Joaquin County and East Bay, CA.

The platform aggregates signals from community sources including:

- Facebook group screenshots
- Community flyers and event graphics
- Neighborhood announcements
- Manual resident submissions
- Curated RSS feeds (filtered for positive content)

Signals are processed through an AI-assisted ingestion pipeline that performs:

- OCR text extraction
- Signal classification
- Structured data extraction
- Human moderation workflow

**Nothing publishes automatically. All signals require human moderation before going live.**

---

# 2. SUPPORTED CITIES

Active cities:

- Mountain House
- Tracy
- Lathrop
- Manteca
- Brentwood

The architecture supports expansion to additional cities without structural changes.

Planned expansion candidates: Stockton, Modesto, Riverbank, Oakdale, Antioch, Discovery Bay.

# 10. SCREENSHOT SIGNAL PIPELINE

This is the core AI ingestion workflow for MoHoLocal.

```
Facebook Groups / Flyers / Community Images
↓
Screenshot captured
↓
Placed in /signals-inbox/raw
↓
process-signals.mjs (OCR pipeline)
↓
OCR text extraction (Tesseract.js)
↓
Signal classification
↓
Structured field extraction
↓
POST /submit-signal
↓
community_submissions table (needs_review = true)
↓
/admin moderation queue
↓
Human approves or rejects
↓
POST /promote-submission
↓
Promoted to live tables:
  events
  lost_and_found
  community_posts
```

Key pipeline files:

```
scripts/process-signals.mjs   — OCR + classification + Supabase upload
signals-inbox/raw/            — Drop screenshots here for processing
```

Pipeline rules:

- All submissions land in `community_submissions` with `needs_review = true`
- Nothing is published without human approval in `/admin`
- OCR noise filtering runs before submission to remove garbage lines
- Image uploads go to Supabase Storage `community-images` bucket

---

# 11. INGESTION WORKER

Cloudflare Worker handles automated ingestion and signal routing.

Worker endpoints:

```
POST /submit-signal      — intake new signal from pipeline
POST /promote-submission — promote approved submission to live table
```

Worker responsibilities:

- Signal intake from pipeline
- RSS ingestion (filtered)
- Image extraction
- Deduplication
- Classification
- Moderation flagging

Scheduled ingestion jobs may run via Cloudflare Cron Triggers.

---

# 12. CONTENT POLICY

MoHoLocal focuses exclusively on **positive community information**.

Allowed content:

- Community events
- School activities
- Local markets and pop-ups
- Business openings and promotions
- Lost and found pets
- Neighborhood announcements
- Family and youth activities

Disallowed content:

- Crime news
- Police reports
- Violent incidents
- Regional tragedy news
- Political content
- Divisive or inflammatory posts

RSS adapters must filter violent or crime-heavy sources (e.g. 209times crime section).

---

# 13. DATABASE TABLES

## businesses

Fields:
- id, name, description, category, city
- address, phone, website
- rating, review_count
- image_url, status
- contact_email, hours
- claimed, verified, created_at

Additional verification fields:
- verified (bool, default false)
- google_place_id (text, optional)
- verification_source (text — audit trail)
- verified_at (timestamptz)

Directory only displays `status = 'approved'` AND `verified = true`

All public queries must include both `.eq('status', 'approved')` and `.eq('verified', true)`

Categories:
- Restaurants
- Health & Wellness
- Beauty & Spa
- Retail
- Education
- Automotive
- Real Estate
- Home Services
- Pet Services

---

## events

Important field: `start_date`

Always sort using:

```
.order('start_date')
```

---

## lost_and_found

Important column: `type NOT NULL`

Storage bucket: `pet-images`

---

## reviews

Auto trigger updates:
- businesses.rating
- businesses.review_count

---

## community_posts

Categories:
- General, Recommendations, For Sale, Free Items
- Jobs, Services, Safety, Neighbors, Question

Storage bucket: `community-images`

---

## community_submissions

Moderation staging table.

Key field: `needs_review` (bool)

All signals land here first. Nothing goes live until promoted by a human moderator.

---

## business_images

Gallery images for business listings.

Fields:
- id, business_id, image_url, alt_text, position, source, source_reference, verified, created_at

New columns (added 2026-03-12):
- `source` — TEXT, one of: `google_places`, `owner_upload`, `admin_verified`, `unknown`
- `source_reference` — TEXT, stores the Google `photo_reference` string (not the Place ID — Place ID lives on `businesses.google_place_id`)
- `verified` — BOOLEAN, default false. Only `verified = true` images render in gallery.

**Current state (as of 2026-03-12):** All ~3,994 Unsplash stock photos permanently deleted. Mountain House pipeline complete: 6 businesses, 25 verified Google Places photos live. `seed_business_images.py` permanently disabled.

**Gallery query filter (in `getBusinessImages()`):**
```ts
.eq('verified', true)
.in('source', ['google_places', 'owner_upload', 'admin_verified'])
```

Component: `app/components/ImageGallery.tsx` renders verified images. The previous hotfix (`verifiedImages = []`) has been removed.

**Google Places Photo Pipeline:**

Script: `verify_business_places.py` (in project root)

Pipeline flow:
```
Verified business → Find Place from Text API → Place ID
→ Place Details API → Photo references (max 5)
→ Place Photos API → Download JPEG
→ Supabase Storage (business-images bucket)
→ INSERT into business_images (source=google_places, verified=true)
```

Usage:
```bash
# All verified businesses
python3 verify_business_places.py

# Single city
python3 verify_business_places.py --city "Mountain House"

# Single business
python3 verify_business_places.py --business-id "<uuid>"

# Dry run
python3 verify_business_places.py --dry-run
```

Requires `GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY` in `.env.local`.

**Acceptable image sources:**
- `google_places` — via verified pipeline
- `owner_upload` — via claim listing flow (future)
- `admin_verified` — manually approved by founder

**Prohibited image sources:**
- Stock photos (Unsplash, Pexels, etc.)
- AI-generated images
- Generic category placeholders

**Rule:** Never insert images with `verified = false` or `source = 'unknown'` into the gallery rendering path.

# 19. CURRENT PRIORITIES

1. Data quality improvements
2. Business detail page UX
3. SEO category pages
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Directory search improvements
6. Email notifications
7. Community board improvements
8. Worker cron agents for events
9. Featured listings monetization
10. Expand signal pipeline coverage

---

# 20. KNOWN GOTCHAS

1. GitHub API sometimes blocked in cowork VM — use low-level git (hash-object → mktree → commit-tree)
2. Supabase REST blocked in cowork VM — write SQL as text for manual execution
3. Edge runtime required for all pages
4. Tailwind dynamic classes break builds — use static class names only
5. RLS policies required on all Supabase tables
6. Storage bucket policies required for uploads
7. Always use `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` in SQL migrations
8. Normalize status column across tables
9. PawBoost blocked by proxy
10. index.lock blocking git add — use low-level git workflow
11. When committing via low-level git, always read-tree from remote FETCH_HEAD — never from local HEAD (which may be stale)
12. Use dollar-quoting (`$$...$$`) in SQL when string contains em-dashes or special characters
13. `image_url` column may not appear in Supabase schema cache for INSERT — omit null columns from payload
14. GitHub API blocked in Cowork VM — use `push-one.sh` or batch push scripts from Mac terminal (GitHub REST API with PAT)
15. Never seed businesses without verifying against Google Maps first — 63% of original Mountain House seeds were fake
16. Gallery images now filtered by `verified=true` + `source in (google_places, owner_upload, admin_verified)` — never render unverified or stock images
17. All public business queries must include both `.eq('status', 'approved')` AND `.eq('verified', true)` — enforced on 9 pages
18. Verification SQL must use exact UUIDs — never ILIKE or name pattern matching (Supabase SQL Editor corrupts `%` in ILIKE patterns when pasted from chat)
19. `verify_business_places.py` must run from the founder's Mac terminal — the Cowork VM proxy blocks both Supabase REST and Google Places API calls
20. Sitemap (`/api/sitemap`) must filter businesses by BOTH `status='approved'` AND `verified=true` — fixed March 2026

---

# 20.1 DEPLOYMENT FALLBACK — PUSH SCRIPTS

The Cowork VM proxy blocks `api.github.com`. When Claude cannot push directly, the founder runs push scripts from the Mac terminal.

**Push a single file:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/MoHoLocal
bash push-one.sh app/page.tsx "commit message here"
```

**Push multiple files in batch:**
```bash
cd ~/Desktop/MoHoLocal
bash push-verified-patch.sh
```

Push script files (in `~/Desktop/MoHoLocal/`):
- `push-one.sh` — single file push
- `push-to-github.sh` — single file push (alternate)
- `push-verified-patch.sh` — batch push for verified filter files

These scripts use the GitHub REST API with a PAT stored in the script. The PAT has no expiration. Do not regenerate unless compromised.

Each file push creates a commit on `main` and triggers a Cloudflare build. Only the last build matters.

---

# 21. SEED SCRIPTS

```
seed_businesses.py
seed_businesses_2.py
seed_businesses_3.py
seed_businesses_4.py
seed_businesses_brentwood.py
seed_businesses_brentwood_extra.py

seed_events.py

seed_lost_and_found.py
seed_lost_and_found_2.py
```

---

# 22. MARKET CONTEXT

MoHoLocal fills a gap for hyperlocal discovery in the 209 and East Bay:

- Nextdoor = social only, not structured
- Yelp = generic, not hyperlocal
- Facebook groups = unstructured, moderated poorly

## Phase Roadmap

- Phase 1 — Foundation ✅
- Phase 2 — Growth (current)
- Phase 3 — Monetization
- Phase 4 — Regional expansion

---

# 23. LOCAL AUTHORITY SEO ARCHITECTURE

MoHoLocal grows by becoming the **authoritative local knowledge hub** for each supported city. Authority is built through structured, indexable pages targeting specific local search intents.

## City Authority Page Structure

```
/[city]                        — City hub page
/[city]/[category]             — Category page (e.g. /mountain-house/restaurants)
/best/[category]/[city]        — Best Of page (e.g. /best/dentists/tracy)
/new-resident/[city]           — New resident guide
/business/[id]                 — Individual business with JSON-LD structured data
```

Every supported city generates multiple indexable discovery pages. The more pages indexed with accurate, verified local data, the more Google treats MoHoLocal as the authority for that city.

## Local Authority Loop

```
Local content (verified businesses, events, signals)
→ Google indexes structured city/category pages
→ Residents discover pages via local search
→ Local mentions and backlinks from community sharing
→ Google trust increases for moholocal.com
→ Higher rankings for local queries
→ More organic discovery
→ More listings, events, and signals contributed
→ Authority compounds
```

This loop is the core growth engine. Every verified listing strengthens it. Fake or inaccurate data breaks it.

## SEO Implementation Status

- JSON-LD structured data: implemented on `/business/[id]`, `/[city]/[category]`, `/best/[category]/[city]`
- `generateMetadata` exports: implemented on `/business/[id]`, `/[city]`, `/[city]/[category]`, `/best/[category]/[city]`, `/new-resident/[city]`
- City pages, category pages, and Best Of pages: all rendering with verified data

---

# 24. TRUST-FIRST DIRECTORY ARCHITECTURE

## Verified Business System (Implemented March 2026)

The business directory uses a trust-first model. No listing appears publicly unless independently verified.

**Database columns:**

| Column | Type | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `verified` | bool (default false) | Gate — only `true` businesses appear publicly |
| `verification_source` | text | Audit trail — e.g. `google_maps_audit_2026-03-12` |
| `verified_at` | timestamptz | When verification occurred |
| `google_place_id` | text | Optional — for future Google Maps API linking |

**Public query pattern (required on all public pages):**

```ts
.from('businesses')
.select('*')
.eq('status', 'approved')
.eq('verified', true)
```

**Pages enforcing this filter (9 total):**

1. `app/page.tsx` — homepage (6 queries)
2. `app/directory/page.tsx` — directory listing
3. `app/business/[id]/page.tsx` — business detail + related businesses
4. `app/[city]/page.tsx` — city hub (3 queries)
5. `app/[city]/[category]/page.tsx` — category page
6. `app/best/[category]/[city]/page.tsx` — Best Of page
7. `app/new-resident/[city]/page.tsx` — new resident guide (3 queries)
8. `app/claim-listing/[id]/page.tsx` — claim form (2 queries)
9. `app/report-listing/[id]/page.tsx` — report form

`app/admin/page.tsx` intentionally does NOT filter by verified — admins need full visibility.

**Verification audit status:**

| City | Status | Verified | Total |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| Mountain House | Audited 2026-03-12 | 17 | 142 |
| Tracy | Pending | 0 | ~200 |
| Lathrop | Pending | 0 | ~200 |
| Manteca | Pending | 0 | ~200 |
| Brentwood | Pending | 0 | ~200 |

## Image Integrity System (Live — March 2026)

The verified Google Places photo pipeline is operational. Galleries render on business detail pages for businesses with verified images.

**Supabase Storage:**
- Bucket: `business-images` (public read)
- Image path: `{business_uuid}/{0-4}.jpg`
- Uploads: Service Role Key (bypasses RLS)

**Gallery query enforcement (`getBusinessImages()`):**
```ts
.eq('verified', true)
.in('source', ['google_places', 'owner_upload', 'admin_verified'])
```

**Pipeline script:** `verify_business_places.py` (project root, runs on Mac — not in Cowork VM)

**Pipeline guardrails:**
- Never overwrite existing `google_place_id`
- Only process `verified = true` businesses
- Reject city/region pages (e.g. "Mountain House CA")
- Reject multiple candidates (ambiguous)
- Reject name similarity < 0.55
- Reject wrong-city Google addresses
- Max 5 photos per business
- 1 second rate limit between API calls
- `source_reference` = Google `photo_reference` (not Place ID)

**Acceptable sources:** `google_places`, `owner_upload`, `admin_verified`

**Prohibited:** stock photos, AI-generated images, scraped images, category placeholders

**Seed script lockdown:** All image/business seed scripts permanently disabled:
- `seed_business_images.py.DISABLED` — was inserting Unsplash stock photos
- `seed_businesses_5.py.DISABLED` — was inserting businesses with Unsplash stock `image_url` + `verified: false`
- `seed_businesses_6.py.DISABLED` — same as above

No seed script may insert images or unverified businesses.

**Mountain House results:** 6 businesses, 25 photos, 0 false matches

---

# 25. CRON & WORKER AUDIT (March 2026)

All automated jobs reviewed against the verified-business / verified-photo trust model.

## Cloudflare Worker: `moho-ingestion`

Cron schedule (UTC):
- `0 3 * * 1` — Monday 03:00 — Directory ingestion
- `0 4 * * 1` — Monday 04:00 — Events ingestion
- `0 5 * * 1` — Monday 05:00 — Lost & Found ingestion

Manual triggers: `/run/directory`, `/run/events`, `/run/lostfound`

### Job 1: Directory Ingestion — SAFE

Sources: Manual JSON feed, Chamber RSS, Yelp API (optional)

Trust model compliance:
- All records land as `status='pending'` — never auto-approved
- Never touches `business_images` table
- Never inserts stock/placeholder images into gallery
- `image_url` on businesses table is an external URL reference (Yelp, og:image) — not a gallery photo
- `verified` flag is NOT set by the worker — requires manual founder verification
- Low-confidence records flagged with `needs_review=true`

Verdict: **Safe as-is. No changes required.**

### Job 2: Events Ingestion — SAFE

Sources: City calendars, SJ County, Tracy Press, 209times, Patch, Eventbrite (optional)

Trust model compliance:
- Most records land as `ingestion_status='pending'`
- Only Eventbrite events with high confidence auto-approve — this is acceptable because events don't have a `verified` field and Eventbrite is a trusted structured source
- Crime content filter blocks harmful content
- Stale events (7+ days past) auto-archived
- Does not touch businesses or business_images

Verdict: **Safe as-is. No changes required.**

### Job 3: Lost & Found Ingestion — SAFE

Sources: SJ Animal Services, 209times, Tracy Press, Patch, PetFinder (optional)

Trust model compliance:
- ALL records land with `needs_review=true` — no auto-approval
- Does not touch businesses or business_images
- Stale records (30+ days) auto-archived

Verdict: **Safe as-is. No changes required.**

### Community Signal Inbox — SAFE

Endpoint: `POST /submit-signal`

Trust model compliance:
- All submissions land with `needs_review=true`
- Admin approval required via `POST /promote-submission` (Supabase JWT auth)
- `business_update` type never auto-promotes — requires founder review
- Does not touch business_images

Verdict: **Safe as-is. No changes required.**

### Sitemap Generation — FIXED

Endpoint: `GET /api/sitemap`

Issue found: Was filtering businesses by `status='approved'` only, without `verified=true`. This meant unverified businesses could appear in the sitemap and get indexed by Google.

Fix applied: Added `verified: 'true'` to the filter, so only `status='approved' AND verified=true` businesses appear in the sitemap.

Verdict: **Fixed. Now compliant with trust model.**

### Seed Scripts — RETIRED

Scripts disabled (renamed to `.DISABLED`):
- `seed_business_images.py` — was inserting Unsplash stock gallery photos
- `seed_businesses_5.py` — was inserting businesses with stock `image_url` + `verified: false`
- `seed_businesses_6.py` — same as above

Remaining seed scripts (`seed_businesses.py` through `seed_businesses_4.py`, `seed_events.py`, `seed_lost_and_found*.py`) are founder-manual only and do not insert images into `business_images`.

Verdict: **Dangerous scripts retired. Remaining scripts are manual-only.**

### Frontend Pages — VERIFIED SAFE

All public-facing business listing pages already enforce both filters:
- `app/[city]/[category]/page.tsx` — `.eq('status', 'approved').eq('verified', true)`
- `app/best/[category]/[city]/page.tsx` — `.eq('status', 'approved').eq('verified', true)`
- `app/business/[id]/page.tsx` — gallery: `.eq('verified', true).in('source', [...])`
- `app/directory/page.tsx` — `.eq('status', 'approved').eq('verified', true)` (enforced in previous patch)

### Worker Image Handling — SAFE

The `workers/lib/images.ts` module only resolves external image URLs (Yelp API, og:image, schema.org). It never downloads image binaries, never uploads to Supabase Storage, and never writes to `business_images`. The resolved `image_url` is stored as a string reference on the `businesses`/`events`/`lost_and_found` table row — this is the hero/thumbnail image, not the gallery.

---

# 26. CITY EXPANSION STRATEGY

MoHoLocal prioritizes **density before expansion**. A city must have verified directory coverage before appearing publicly on the platform.

**Launch focus order:**

1. Mountain House (audit complete)
2. Tracy (audit pending)
3. Lathrop (audit pending)
4. Manteca (audit pending)
5. Brentwood (audit pending)

**Expansion readiness checklist:**

- Business directory seeded with real businesses
- Google Maps verification audit completed
- `verified = true` set on confirmed businesses
- New Resident Guide populated
- Best Of pages generating with verified data
- City hub page rendering correctly

No new city should be added until the existing 5 cities have verified directory coverage.
