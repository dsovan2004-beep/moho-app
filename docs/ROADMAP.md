## Current Sprint Priorities

From CLAUDE.md §10 — active engineering focus:

1. Data quality improvements
2. Business detail page UX
3. SEO category pages (`/[city]/[category]`)
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Directory search improvements
6. Email notifications
7. Community board improvements
8. Worker cron agents for event ingestion
9. Featured listings monetization

## Design Standard

Before adding any feature to the roadmap, it must pass all six questions:

1. Does this improve local usefulness?
2. Does this improve repeat usage?
3. Does this improve trust?
4. Does this increase contribution?
5. Can this scale city to city?
6. Does this keep the platform simple?

**If the answer is no to any of these, do not build it yet.**
