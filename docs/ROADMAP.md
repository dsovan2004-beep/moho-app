## CURRENT SPRINT — March 2026

**Focus:** Directory UX and regional discovery improvements

1. **Activity Feed Page** — Build `/activity` page showing:
   - Recent businesses
   - New events
   - Community updates
   - Layout: mobile-friendly, card-based design

2. **Business Detail Page UX Improvements**
   - Add Share button
   - Add Google Map embed
   - Keep Get Directions button (already implemented)
   - Maintain existing gallery functionality

3. **Pending Queue Audit** — Cities: Tracy, Lathrop, Manteca, Brentwood
   - Goal: move real businesses from `pending` → `approved + verified`

4. **Directory Pagination Safety**
   - Ensure directory queries use pagination or limits (e.g. `LIMIT 50`)
   - Pages must not attempt to load all listings at once

5. **Regional Discovery Entry**
   - Add "Explore Near You" or "Discover the Region" entry point
   - Surface popular businesses, trending places, and upcoming events across:
     Mountain House, Tracy, Lathrop, Manteca, and Brentwood

## DATA EXPANSION — City Coverage

**Purpose:** Increase verified business coverage across the regional corridor.

**Target:** 500–1,000 verified businesses per city.

| City | County | Coverage Goal |
|------|--------|---------------|
| Mountain House | San Joaquin | 500–1,000 verified |
| Tracy | San Joaquin | 500–1,000 verified |
| Lathrop | San Joaquin | 500–1,000 verified |
| Manteca | San Joaquin | 500–1,000 verified |
| Brentwood | Contra Costa | 500–1,000 verified |

**Focus categories (in priority order):**

1. Restaurants
2. Health Services
3. Beauty Services
4. Home Services
5. Fitness
6. Automotive

**Operating rules:**

- All new businesses must pass Google Maps verification before being set to `approved + verified`
- Seed scripts must default to `status='pending'` and `verified=false`
- Bulk seeding must use the trust policy guard (`validate_trust_policy()`) before any network calls
- This is an ongoing effort — not gated on sprint completion

## Overview

The MoHoLocal roadmap is organized into 6 sequential phases, progressing from platform stability through full regional expansion. Each phase builds on the previous one. Features are not added unless they pass the [Design Standard](#design-standard).

---

**Goal:** Core platform works reliably for real residents.

2. Business detail page UX
3. SEO category pages (`/[city]/[category]`)
4. Mobile responsiveness
5. Directory search improvements
6. Email notifications
7. Community board improvements
8. Worker cron agents for event ingestion
9. Featured listings monetization
10. Pending queue audit — Tracy, Lathrop, Manteca, Brentwood (~200 records each awaiting review)

---

## Design Standard

Before adding any feature to the roadmap, it must pass all six questions:

1. Does this improve local usefulness?
2. Does this improve repeat usage?
3. Does this improve trust?
4. Does this increase contribution?
5. Can this scale city to city?
6. Does this keep the platform simple?

**If the answer is no to any of these, do not build it yet.**
